           <h4> COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERING</h4>
              <img src="assets/images/computer.jpg">
                <p>Computer science engineering includes the study of design, computational processes and programming languages. Students get to learn technical know-how about how to develop a variety of hardwares and softwares and gain knowledge about communications systems and other similar devices. Usually students and potential candidates tend to confuse computer science engineering and computer science as one subject. There is a large difference between both subjects. Computer science is a study focussed on troubleshooting issues on a software level. This study deals with programming languages and operating systems and learning the technical aspects related to softwares and its advancements. On the other hand, computer engineering is a study focussed on hardware and software interface development as well as its related problems.</p>
                <p>Computer science encopmpases the studty of various topuics such as languages, programming, algorithms, program designing and software designing. The field of computer science has its roots embedded in subjects such as maths, electrical engineering and linguistics. A computer science engineer works to design and develop software applications, networks as well as manage hardware if necessary. They often write codes for softwares, electrical devices such as printers, modems and scanners to name a few. They also write codes for operating systems such as Windows and Linux. 

Computer engineering is a branch of study where individuals design and develop various technological devices and computer systems. They basically research, design and develop processors, motherboards, circuit boards, memory devices, routers and test computer systems. A computer engineer works to integrate the developed components into network systems and computers as per the respective requirement. Usually, computer engineers work on another important aspect called software development. They work on a variety of other aspects such as CAD (computer assisted design), CAM (computer assisted manufacturing), world wide web, voice over internet protocol, networking and communications. This also includes compiling and debugging in programming languages, anti-virus, encryption, firewalls and user authentication.</p>

           <h4> ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING</h4>
              <img src="assets/images/electrical.jpg">
                <p>Electrical Engineering, one of the science branches deals with the technical aspects of electricity. In Electrical Engineering branch aspirants learn about the wide range of electrical components, devices and systems. The branch impart knowledge from tiny microchips to huge power station generators. Students who are keen to study Electrical Engineering, can opt for this branch during graduation (B.Tech, B.E. and B.Sc) or post graduation (M.Tech, M.E. and M.Sc). The Electrical Engineering curriculum encompasses the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. Not only this, candidates can also opt for a wide range of specializations in E.E. (Electrical Engineering) such as acoustics, speech, automobiles to vehicular technology, signal processing to electromagnetic compatibility, geo-science and remote sensing, ferroelectrics and frequency control, robotics, ultra-sonic, laser and electro-optics. This course grants adequate knowledge and practical skills to students which can be used in various fields. The work area of electrical engineers is very wide as it ranges from the power industry to the automation sector. However, to earn a lucrative salary one needs to be specially skillful in a specific domain. </p>
                <p>Electrical engineering is an evergreen field of opportunities. It touches nearly every facet of our lives. They form the foundation of our lives with new innovations, technologies and ways to make our life easier. New jobs are being generated as more MNCs and research organizations are being established in India. They work in every large-scale production company such as manufacturing, IT industry, telecommunications and aerospace. The scale of opportunities isnâ€™t just limited to private industries, government sectors also provide plenty of jobs for electrical engineers.</p>

           <h4> MECHANICAL ENGINEERING</h4>
              <img src="assets/images/mechanical.jpg">
                <p>Mechanical engineering is a professional programme which helps students to understand the working mechanisms of heavy tools and machineries.  The branch applies principles of engineering, physics and material science for the design, analysis, manufacturing and maintenance of mechanical systems. The course covers technical areas like distribution of electricity through generators, transformers, transmission lines, lighting and wiring in buildings. A course in mechanical engineering makes a student gain knowledge and experience in the designing of electric motors, automobiles, aircrafts and other heavy vehicles. Mechanical engineering demands knowledge about software used in technical work like computer-aided design and mathematical modelling.</p>
                <p>Mechanical Engineering covers aspects like design and testing among others. The job demands supervision and planning of live projects related to thermal power plants, nuclear stations, generation of electricity, etc.
There are employment opportunities for diploma holders who have practical knowledge of working on fields like testing of machinery etc.
The emerging fields in this area include renewable energy, automobiles, quality control, Industrial Automation, Mechanobiology. These are going to increase manpower in the work profile of mechanical engineering and would offer employment opportunities.</p>
